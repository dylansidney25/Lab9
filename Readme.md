This lab was meant to create and enforce a basic understanding to execute
a communication between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. The Pi Code creates a
GUI with sliders and buttons that change, save, and recall motor positions 
that are controled by the arduino. The code works in the range from -90 to +90
degrees for boths servos and can save as many instances of angles as the user
pleases.
